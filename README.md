### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Richard, Coding here under the name @hibiscus-coding

**Background** <br/>
My background as far as studies goes is in law and other related studies. 
Looking to get into coding, have some (quite outdated) C++ knowledge since highschool but would say that I'm starting from scratch.

In the last couple of months I have tried my hands at a few different programming languages to get a feel for it. Some basic HTML5 and CSS, basic Javascript, as well as some Python.

**Ambitions** <br/>
At the moment I'm not sure what my specific ambitions with programming are. But as for the bigger picture-ambitions I am aiming to be able to transition to some sort of remote work in programming in the next few years.
